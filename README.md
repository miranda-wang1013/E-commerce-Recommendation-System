# Product Recommendation System for E-commerce Businesses

## Introduction
This Product Recommendation System is designed to enhance the shopping experience for customers on e-commerce websites, aiding in effective customer acquisition and retention. The system is tailored for a customer's journey from their initial visit to the website through to repeated purchases.

## System Overview
The recommendation system is structured into three distinct parts, each addressing different stages of a customer's interaction with the e-commerce platform:

## Part I: Product Popularity-Based System for New Customers
- **Target Audience:** New customers without prior purchase history.
- **Functionality:**  Recommends the most popular products on the website, based on overall sales data. This part is crucial for first-time visitors, providing them with a curated list of trending and popular items.

## Part II: Collaborative Filtering-Based System
- **Target Audience:**  Customers with existing purchase history.
- **Functionality:** Implements a model-based collaborative filtering approach, utilizing the customer's own purchase history and the ratings provided by other users who purchased similar items. This system becomes more effective and personalized as the customer's interaction with the website increases.

## Part III: Setup for New E-commerce Websites
- **Application:** For businesses establishing their e-commerce presence without existing product ratings.
- **Functionality:** This part of the system is designed to kickstart the recommendation engine for new e-commerce sites. It provides an initial set of recommendations based on available data (like product categorization, initial sales data, etc.) until enough user data is gathered for more personalized recommendations.

## Technical Details
- **Data Handling:** The system handles various data types, including product information, user purchase history, and user ratings.
- **Algorithms Used:** For collaborative filtering, matrix factorization techniques and similarity metrics are employed.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to scale with the increasing amount of user data and expanding product inventory.

## Usage
- **For New Customers:** Simply visit the website, and the system will present the most popular items.
- **For Returning Customers:** The system tracks your purchase history and preferences, offering increasingly personalized recommendations.
- **For E-commerce Businesses:** Deploy this system to offer your customers a personalized shopping experience from day one.

## Final Note
This Product Recommendation System represents a comprehensive approach to understanding and catering to customer preferences, enhancing the overall shopping experience and fostering customer loyalty.
